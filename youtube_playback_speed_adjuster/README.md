## Youtube PlaybackSpeed Adjuster

Sometimes, there are youtube tutorials that talks slowly, and you are just not patient enough to wait until the part you really want to watch. You want to adjust the playback speed often. Yes, youtube offers convenient shortcuts (`Shift + .` and `Shift + ,`), but only limit until 2 times speed. This script lets you speed up more than that.

Tbh, I used this to watch some games' story mode and conversations (I'm too lazy to play the game but just curious of the story) and I speed up to 8x to skip all the walking and battle parts. Feel free to use this for that purpose too.

I assume you have some experience in JavaScript.

### How to use:
1. Paste the whole script to browser DevTools Console
2. Enjoy :D

### Shortcuts:

| Key | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| R | 1x Speed |
| E | 2x Speed |
| W | 4x Speed |
| Q | 8x Speed |
| A | -0.5x Speed |
| D | +0.5x Speed |

For now, the only way to check current speed is from DevTools Console.

By the way, the script can also work on local video files opened in browser (I use chrome, never tested with other browser though).
