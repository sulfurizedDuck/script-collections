## Script Collections

Here are some scripts I frequently uses in my daily work life. They are, indeed, crude and not easy to use, but might help you in some way. Here are list of scripts available. More details will be covered at each script directory's readme.

List of scripts:
- youtube_partial_repeater: Repeat youtube musics - but only a portion of them
- youtube_playback_speed_adjuster: Adjust video playback rate - works for local video files too
