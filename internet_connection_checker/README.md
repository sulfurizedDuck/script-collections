## Internet Connection Checker

Sometimes your internet provider is just such a git. They just cut off your internet at the times you really need it (in an important meeting, debugging and heavily need stackoverflow, on a climax part of a very touching romance movie, etc.). You lost all motivation and didn't want to stare at your laptop while waiting your internet to come into. You just want to lay down and constantly curse your landlord (or do whatever you want). But at the same time, you want to be notified immediately when the internet returns.

This script will do just that. It kinda 'ping' google and wait for any response every second. And when your internet returned, when the 'ping' succeeded, an simple alarm will play and you can finally return to do what you are supposed to.

How to use:
1. Ensure python is installed in your machine
2. Ensure the needed libraries are in place (os, httplib/http.client, winsound)
3. Run the script using cmd or equal
4. Enjoy :D
