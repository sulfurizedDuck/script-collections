## Youtube Partial Repeater

There are some music videos on youtube that consists of more than one music. You like the musics and wanted to repeat them, but you only liked a portion of them, lets say, 2nd music until 5th music (there are 10 musics in that one video). You are troubled, so you come to the right place!

I assume you have some experience in JavaScript.

How to use:
1. Mark the start second and end second of the music portion you want to repeat
2. Add new music object at by copying *template*  as new property and fill the music detail
3. Change the variable *play* value to your new music name
4. Paste the whole script to browser DevTools Console
5. Enjoy :D

Note: The repeat will last until you refresh the browser, so if you decide to change music, remember to refresh the browser :D
